# CommandLineChess
A two player game of chess for COMP 401, Foundations of Programming. Uses an MVC structure with event listeners and observable objects. Supports move commands, a repeatable undo command, and a log of past moves. Malformed and illegal move commands throw exceptions which are caught by the main game loop.
